Not practical.\n\n## Quota Rule\n\nThe *quota rule* describes a desired property of proportional apportionment methods. It says that the number of seats allocated to a party should be equal to their entitlement plus or minus one.\n\n## Method of Fixed Ratio\n- Rounding up\n- Rounding down\n- Standard rounding (round 5 up and 4 down)\n\n**New problem**: variable seats (too many or too few) \n\n- 1787-1790 (first enumeration):   65 set by the Constitution\n- 1790-1830 (Jefferson method: fixed ratio with rounding down): resulting 105 seats. \n\n- 1840 (Webster method): fixed ratio with standard rounding.  \n\n\n\n## Fixed House Size\n- 1911:  House size was fixed at 433 with provision for the addition of one seat each for Arizona and New Mexico when they became states (U.S. Statutes at Large, 37 Stat 13, 14 (1911))\n- The House size, 435 members, has been unchanged since, except for a temporary  increase to 437 at the time of admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states (following the 1950 census until the 1960 census).\n\n## Mathematical Formulation\n\nGiven $(t_1,t_2,\\cdots, t_k)$,  find \na vector of non-negative integers $(n_1,n_2,\\cdots, n_k)$, such that \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=1}^k{t^*_i}&=1\\\\\n\\sum_{i=1}^k n_i &=h\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n$$\\text{minimize expectated } \\textbf{ errors or seat bias}\\,.$$\ne.g. favoring smaller parties, or large parties, etc. \n\n## How to solve the problem with fixed house size (1850-1900)? \n1. **Largest remainder method**(Hamilton/Vinton method) first assign integral seats to each state, then assign the remaining seat one at a time with the largest remainder. \n  - **Advantage**: Meet the quota rule\n  - **Problem**: sbj. population, Alabama, no-show paradox.\n- Had Congress used Webster or Hamilton's method (as it had since 1840), the 1876 election would have gone to Tilden instead of Hayes.\n\n## How to solve the problem with fixed house size (1910, 1930)\n2. (1910, 1930)  **Webster method with a preselected fixed ratio**: The ratio was selected (trial-and-error) so that the result would be the predetermined size of the House of Representatives.\n \n\n## How to solve the problem with fixed house size\n3. **Highest  vote average (votes per seat)**: Starting from 0 for each state, assign a seat one a time to the state that has the highest vote **average** per seat.\n\nAverage by dividing $P_i$ by\n\n- $n$ \n- $(n+1)$  \n- between $n$ and $(n+1)$ (continuity correction)? which one?\n\n## Highest Vote Average (votes per seat) Method (Divisor Method)\n\n- Adam (divided by the current seats $n$; rounding up)\n- Jefferson/D'Hondt (divided by $(n+1)$; rounding down) favors large parties. \"**ghosts of departed representatives**\"\n- Webster/Saine-Lagne (divided by $n+\\frac{1}{2}$, standard rounding:  unbiased in terms of expected seat bias).\n- Huntington-Hill (Method of equal proportions) (divided by $\\sqrt{n\\cdot(n+1})$, Geometric rounding): unbiased in terms of relative percentage error, adopted by **U.S. Congress** (US code Title 2) in 1941 following the census of 1940. \n\n## Comparison and historical anecdotes\n- Huntington-Hill's method and Webster's method very similar; \n- when first used, differed only in whether assigned a single seat to Michigan or Arkansas.\n\n- Following the 1990 census, two lawsuits concerning apportionment issues were filed in federal courts. The **U.S. Supreme Court** held that the **method of equal proportions was constitutional**; \n- US Department of Commerce v. Montana 112 S.Ct. 1415 (1992) and Franklin v. Massachusetts 112 S.Ct. 2767 (1992).\n\n## Propoerties of Divisor Methods (Highest Vote Averge)\n- Monotoniciy: voting for a party can never cause it to lose seats (No-show paradox)\n- House Monononiciy: Increasing the number of seats should not case a state to lose a seat (Alabama Paradox)\n- Min-Max inequality: It is impossible to lower the highest vote average by reassigning a sear from one party to another. \n$$\n\\max \\left\\{\\frac{\\text{votes[party]}}{\\text{post(seats[party])}}\\right\\} \\le \\min \\left\\{\\frac{\\text{votes[party]}}{\\text{post(seats[party])}+1}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n## Huntington-Hill Method( Equal Proportions Method): 1940- \n- Every party begins with 0 seats. Then, at each iteration, allocate a seat to the party with the highest vote average (votes per seat) divided by $\\sqrt{n(n+1)}$. \n\n- Minimizes the relative difference in the number of constituents represented by each legislator. In other words, no transfer of a seat from one state to another can reduce the percent error in representation for both states.\n- Conceptually, this method rounds to the integer that has the smallest relative (percent) difference.\n\n## Huntington-Hill Method (Details)\nCompute a *priority value*\n$$\nA_n=\\frac{P_i}{\\sqrt{n(n+1})},\\quad n: \\text{seats before allocaiton}\\,.\n$$\n\n\n- $51$st $\\rightarrow$  **California** with the largest $A_1$. \t\n- $52$nd $\\rightarrow$ **Texas**, because its $A_1>A_n$ of any other state. \n- $53$st $\\rightarrow$  **California**  because its $A_2>A_n$ of any other state. \n- $54$th $\\rightarrow$ **New York** because its $A_1>A_n$  of any other state at this point.\n\n\n\n## Example\n- $P_A=100\\,000$, $P_B=80\\,000$, $P_C=30\\,000$, $P_A+P_B+P_C=210\\,000$. \n- Total number of seats $=8$. \n- Ideal seats =$\\frac{P_i}{P_A+P_B+P_C}\\cdot 8$. \n![](images/Huntington-Hill.png){.border fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1000\"} \n\n## Ghost of Departed Representatives\n![](images/jefferson.png){.border fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1000\"} \nThe Yellow Party: has only $46\\%$ of votes, but won $11/21\\approx 52\\%$ majority seats. Violating the **Majority-preserving clause**. \n\n## Balinski-Young Theorem (1980)\n\n- Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.\n- Any method that is free of the population paradox must fail the quota rule for some circumstances.\n\n- Largest remainder method satisfies the quota rule, it violates the Alabama paradox and the population paradox. \n\n- The highest averages methods violate the quota rule,  avoid  population paradox and no-show paradox. Not sensitive to spoiler effect. only do so (violate quota rule)  rarely. \n\n## Apportionment Paradoxes\n- **Alabama Paradox**\nA state could receive fewer representatives if the size of the House increased.\n\n- **Population paradox**\n$A$ grows at a faster rate than $B$, i.e., ${ A/B}$ increases, then \n${ A}$ should not lose a seat while ${B}$ gains a seat. \n\n- **No-show paradox**\nA particularly severe variant, where voting for a party causes it to lose seats. \n- **Spoiler effect**: a spoiler is a losing candidate who affects the results of an election simply by participating, causing voters to change their opinions.\n\n## Why use geometric mean?\nGiven two positive numbers $a$ and $b$, then the geometric mean of $a$ and $b$ is \n$$\nG=\\sqrt{ab}\\,.\n$$\n**AM-GM theorem:**\n$$\n\\sqrt{ab}\\le \\frac{a+b}{2}\\,.\n$$\nThe equality is true if and if $a=b$. \n\n## GM-equal relative error\n$$\na \\quad \\sqrt{ab} \\quad \\frac{a+b}{2}\\quad b\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{ab}}{a}=\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{ab}}\\,,\n$$\nthat is, the two relative percentage errors are equal:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{ab}-a}{a}=\\frac{b-\\sqrt{ab}}{\\sqrt{ab}}\\,.\n$$\n\n## GM-Example\nFor example, if $a=2$ and $b=3$, then $\\sqrt{2\\cdot 3} \\approx 2.45$. Therefore, for\n$x=2.48$, if performing geometric rounding, $2.48\\approx 3$. This rounding minimize the percentage error:\n$$\n\\frac{2.48-2}{2}=24\\% < \\frac{3-2.48}{2.48}\\approx 21\\%
